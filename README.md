# UVa-Online-Judge

Welcome to my **UVa Online Judge** repository! The purpose of this repository is to showcase my **problem-solving skills** and commitment to writing **clean, efficient code**. By tackling a wide range of algorithmic challenges, I've refined my approach to developing optimal solutions while maintaining code readability and structure.

## üéØ Goal

This repository is a collection of my UVa Online Judge solutions. It demonstrates my ability to:
- Solve complex algorithmic problems with efficiency.
- Write clean Python code that adheres to best practices.
- Think logically and implement solutions that work for a wide range of inputs and edge cases.

## üêç Why Python?

All the solutions in this repository are implemented in **Python**:
- **Readability**: Python‚Äôs clean syntax ensures that code is easy to follow, making it ideal for both personal use and showcasing to others.
- **Efficiency**: Python allows me to focus more on problem-solving rather than worrying about lower-level details, enabling quicker development of solutions.

## üìÇ Structure

The sole folder in this repository contains different UVa problem. Inside, you'll find:
- **Problem description**: A brief explanation of the problem being solved.
- **Python scripts**: Clean, well-documented code that solves the problem.
